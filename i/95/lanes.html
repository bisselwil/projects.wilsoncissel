<h1>I-95 Virginia Lanes</h1>
<br>
<a id="btn" href="index.html">Home</a>
<p>The lanes on I-95 in Virginia vary. This page describes the amount of lanes in each segment.
<br>
<hr>
<h2>I-95 from I-495 to VA-123</h2>
<br>

<p>I-95 here has 4 General Purpose lanes on each side for the most part, just one or 2 more on each side for like a mile south of 495/395. Normally in this area, the lanes reach up to a total of 8 general purpose lanes. Of course there are also exit/auxilery lanes. There are also express lanes on this segment which have 3 lanes. The express lanes are reversible so they only have 3 total. The Toll prices vary from how long your going on them for to if it's rush hour, etc. At VA-123, the 4th lane on the south side of 95 drops, it doesn't exit. This causes a lot of traffic in that area. On the north side, the 4th lane is created by an entrence to the highway.</p>

<h2>VA-123 to US-17/USBUS-17</h2>
<br>
<p>This is quite a long strech. The general purpose lanes of I-95 in this section have 3 lanes on each side making for a total of six general purpose lanes. There are also express lanes in this area as well which have 2 lanes. Once again the tolls vary. There are of course Exit lanes/aux lanes as well.</p>

<h2>I-95 from US 17/USBUS-17 to US-1/US-17</h2>
<br>
<p>Unlike the last segmant, this is a very short segmant running through the city of Fredericksburg. Just north of US-17/USBUS-17, The Express lanes end, and the road splits on each side (Just south as of 10/2/23 due to construction) as a Thru/Local lane road. The thru lanes go through Fredericksburg and have no Exit access to any of the exits in that area includinmg the rest Area. The local lanes haave exit/Entrence access in the city, but that's it. The local lanes have 3 lanes on each side though have 2 near the end on the south side. North side is unknown due to it not being finished yet. All thru lanes have 3 lanes on each side. Of course there are exit/aux lanes as well on the local side. As the south local lanes end just south of VA-3, The soutch side goes to 4 general purpose lanes for about a mile or 2. After that it cuts down to 3 general purpose lanes on each side, 6 lanes total.</p>

<h2>I-95 from US-1/US-17 to CR-802</h2>
<br>
<p>This segmant of I-95 is VERY Long. This is probably one of the simplest segmants of I-95 in the state of Virginia. There are 3 general purpose lanes on each side of I-95, making for a total of 6 General purpose lanes. Those are the only lanes on this segmant except for exits/aux lanes.</p>

<h2>I-95 from CR-802 to I-85</h2>
<br>
<p>Not the simplest segmant, but when it comes to lanes, this is definetly a simple segmant for the most part. One mile south of 802, It's 4 lanes on each side (8 total), however, south of I-295, just 2-3 miles south of 802, it's just six, so just like before. There are many exit/Aux lanes as well when 95 passes through the Richmond-Petersburg Area.</p>

<p>This segmant of I-95 is the simplest of all. Just 2 lanes on each side other then any aux/exit lanes. (4 lanes total)</h2>
